# Linerar_regression_with_python
The following project contains the python code for solving a linear regression problem with multiple variables using numpy, pandas and matplotlib python libraries.
Linear regression with multiple variables
In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to ﬁrst collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. The ﬁle ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The ﬁrst column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
